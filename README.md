## Hi there 👋

I'm Richard - a hobbyist software developer from Manchester in the ☀️ sunny North West of the United Kingdom .

By day I am a professional Product Manager, but my GitHub is entirely for my personal use (🏢 no work here!) .

I'm interested in a number of things including art, music and programming. So, at the moment I am learning more about game development thorugh the Unity and Godot engines, and tinkering with other tools such as MonoGame.

In the past I have also dabbled in web development and so I am fairly proficient with NodeJS and the associated tools (JavaScript, HTML, CSS etc.) but it's not something I am particularly concentrating on at the moment!
